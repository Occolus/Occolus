# Hi, I'm Naufal 👋

Data Scientist focused on turning data into measurable insights—covering end-to-end workflows from data preparation, modeling, evaluation, to simple deployment.

- 🔭 Currently building: NLP (Indonesian text), regression/prediction models, and lightweight ML apps.
- 🌱 Learning: model optimization, deployment, and better experiment tracking.
